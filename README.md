This branch is for Liferay Portal 6.2ee.  If you are looking for fastpacks for Liferay 7 DXP, please refer to the master branch.

The Fastpack is designed for use with Dynatrace versions 6.1 -  6.5. Please note, however, that the fastpack has not been tested on AppMon 6.5. There are no features in the fastpack, though, that have been deprecated in 6.5.

The dynaTrace FastPack provides a preconfigured Dynatrace profile custom tailored to Liferay Portal environments. This FastPack contains sensors, a template system profile with measures and business transactions, and dashboards for the Liferay Portal platform. If you are using UEM, you will also get conversion and visitor tagging. The focus of the fastpack is page performance in relation to the portlets utilized on a page.
